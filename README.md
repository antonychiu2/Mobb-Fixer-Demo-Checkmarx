# Mobb Fixer for GitHub - Demo
### A demo repo showing how Mobb Fixer for GitHub works

Mobb Fixer monitors your pull requests for security issues and produces accurate code fix suggestions on the spot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the workflow to run you must first:
>
> 1. [Enable GitHub Actions](/../../actions) on this repo.
>
> 2. Define **CX_TENANT**, **CX_API_TOKEN**, **CX_BASE_URI** and **CX_BASE_AUTH_URI** in the [repo's secrets page](/../../settings/secrets/actions) (more info [here](https://checkmarx.com/resource/documents/en/34965-68775-generating-a-refresh-token--api-key-.html)).

Then, click below to see how automatic fixes on pull requests work:

[<img width="250" alt="Start a vulnerable pull request" src="https://app.mobb.ai/gh-action/pull-request-button.svg" />](/../../compare/main...introduce-new-security-issue)
\
\
\
This will let you start a pull request from branch `introduce-new-security-issue` to branch `main`.
\
Once the PR is created, Checkmarx will automatically start a security scan and report an issue.
\
Mobb Fixer will immediately run and present a fix suggestion in the PR conversation tab.

> [!TIP]
> Click ***Commit fix*** to immediately apply the fix on the pull request. Security scan will run again and flag the issue as "Fixed".
